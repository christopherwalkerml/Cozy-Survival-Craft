My goal for this was to make my dream minecraft pack, with extra farming, automation, Create, harder vanilla progression, lots of exploration, and questing challenges. I wanted a long-term world, just with... more."
				"I took inspiration from some of my favourite packs such as Agrarian Skies, SevTech Ages, Create Above and Beyond, and added some flair from my own interests. Hopefully you'll enjoy some of the silly references I make in here."
